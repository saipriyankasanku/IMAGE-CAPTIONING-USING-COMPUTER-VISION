# IMAGE-CAPTIONING-USING-COMPUTER-VISION
Image captioning is an interdisciplinary project that merges computer vision and natural language processing to bridge the gap between visual and textual understanding. The primary objective of this project is to develop a model capable of generating descriptive and coherent captions for images, enabling machines to interpret and communicate visual content in a human-like manner. Through the integration of computer vision and natural language processing techniques, this image captioning project aims to contribute to the advancement of AI systems that can seamlessly interpret and describe the visual world, fostering a deeper level of interaction between machines and humans.The Image Captioning project leverages a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) and GPT-2-based model for generating descriptive captions for images.
